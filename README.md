# Pokemon-Api-Testing
Bare bones version of a webapp that uses the PokeAPI.
## To-Do List
*Stylize website <br>
*There seems to be a limit to how many times you GET from the API in a given time, check to see if that can change <br>
*Text sometimes appears weird, not sure if this is a typo in the API or if I just need to format it
